Beta and development versions:

check for testing_* variables used for testing new functionality in beta,
development and canary versions of Google Chrome; updates of some settings of
manifest.json might be required for testing.


Enhancements:

background.html, manifest.json, chess-games-viewer.html,
live-mosaic-viewer.html: remove backward compatible webRequest related code;
see references to http://crbug.com/60101; when removing backward compatible
code, set minimum_chrome_version to 17 or later.

Declarative WebRequest API: monitor webRequest API for improvements in the URL
filtering options.
http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/trunk/experimental.webRequest.html

background.html, manifest.json: registerContentHandler
register the extension as content handler for application/x-chess-pgn
this should allow opening the chess games viewer by doubleclicking items in
the chrome downloads page; needs assessing impact on the plain download of
a PGN file: check what happens when clicking a link on the page or the
download icon of the popup.
http://crbug.com/86115 (and others, search for registerContentHandler)

manifest.json: match mime-types in content scripts
enhance PGN/ZIP URL detection/validation by matching by mime-type when
supported.
http://crbug.com/35070

manifest.json, background.html chess-games-viewer.html,
live-mosaic-viewer.html: storage API
consider using the storage API, for storing local settings and/or to synch
settings (if any) across computers; check limitations in the amount of data
stored (the engine analysis data is about 1MB for 4000 entries); settings
synch might not be supported for self-hosted extensions.
http://crbug.com/47327

background.html: replace file download code with the downloads API
replace the file download code for popup.html witht he download API,
currently experimental; make sure it works with data URIs.

Bugs:

background.html and manifest.json match pattern definition:
because of how match patterns can be defined, some URLs might be identified
as PGN chess games URL even if they should not, for instance
http://host/file.html?pgnData=games.pgn would match *://*/*.pgn
This will lead to a context menu appearing when it should not (but the
mouse pointer will not change and the viewer will not open the link).
http://crbug.com/84024
Possible workaround exist if context scripts could manipulate context menus.
http://crbug.com/77023

manifest.json, background.html and pgnLinks.js: access to file:// URLs
XHR access to file:// URLs is broken; once this is fixed consider extending
the PGN URL definition to include file:// URLs (in the URL validation of
background.html and pgnLinks.js) and injecting the content script into
file:// pages (replace the match pattern *://*/* with <all_urls> in
manifest.json). Relevant for testing sites locally.
http://crbug.com/41024
monitor similar bug for ftp:// URLs, allthough less relevant.

popup.html: hardcoded maximum popup height
- Google Chrome has an hardcoded maximums popup height of 600px (width is 800px);
Monitor the bug report below and update the popup.html code in case of any
changes to the hardcoded maximum popup height.
http://crbug.com/36080
http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/browser/ui/views/extensions/extension_popup.cc?view=markup
Verify the hardcoded popup height by inpsecting the popup from a page with a
large number of PGN links such as http://pgnmentor.com/files.html, clearing
document.getElementById("pgnLinkList").style.maxHeight and reading the
popup outerHeight value.


Other:

about.html, help.html, manifest.json: help page
verify the naming convention ("help") and the manifest syntax for the upcoming
"help" page and update manifest.json, about.html and help.html as needed.
http://crbug.com/29849

about.html, background.html: context menu icons and filename
add icons to context menus (same menu icons of chess-games-viewer.html) and to
the help/practice text in about.html when referencing context menu items.
Maybe remove context menu separators other than the help one.
http://crbug.com/53820
Also consider adding filename to the context menu string once the feature is
available.
http://crbug.com/60758

popup.html, manifest.json: avoid using deprecated chrome.tabs.getSelected
chrome.tabs.getSelected is deprecated as of chrome 16; initially the extension
preserves backward compatibility, eventually consider removing "try" statements
and set minimum_chrome_version to 18 or later.

manifest.json: monitor requirement for setting "manifest_version" to 2 and for
setting related "content_security_policy" fields; currenly "manifest_version"
is set to 1.
