<p>
The chess games viewer extension for Google Chrome is an interactive chessboard showing chess games from links to PGN URLs, from local PGN files and from PGN text, using context menus and page actions.
</p>
<p>
PGN (Portable Games Notation) files are commonly used by chess websites and by chess software to store and share chess games information.
</p>

<h3>context menu for links to PGN chess games URLs</h3>
<p>
A context menu shows chess games from links to PGN chess games URLs.
</p>
<p>
The mouse cursor icon highlights links to PGN chess games URLs when hovering on them.
</p>

<h3>live refresh option</h3>
<p>
The live refresh option reloads the games periodically until all games are ended, as designed for links to chess games live broadcasts.
<p>
A single large chessboard view is offered as well as a view with multiple small chessboards; click on square H5 (assuming White on bottom) to switch between chessboard views.
</p>

<h3>context menu for links to ZIP archives</h3>
<p>
A context menu for links to ZIP archives offers to inspect each ZIP archive for PGN chess games files.
</p>
<p>
Loading ZIP archives is a slow process; only the <i>deflate</i> and <i>store</i> compression methods are supported; encryption is not supported.
</p>

<h3>context menu for local PGN and ZIP files</h3>
<p>
A context menu allows <a href="chess-games-viewer.html">showing chess games from local PGN files and local ZIP archives containing PGN files</a>; drag and drop on the large chessboard view page also opens local files.
</p>
<p>
A browser bookmark can be created for easy access to the chess games viewer page for showing local PGN and ZIP files.
</p>

<h3>context menu for selected PGN chess games text</h3>
<p>
A context menu shows chess games from PGN chess games text selecetd in the web page.
</p>

<h3>page action for links to PGN chess games URLs</h3>
<p>
A page action looks for links to PGN chess games URLs in the current page; if found, a black pawn page action icon appears in the address bar, clicking that icon a popup allows for opening the links in the chess games viewer.
</p>

<h3>user interface help</h3>
<p>
Using the keyboard or clicking squares interacts with the chessboards; hovering the mouse on each square displays an help summary. Clicking square H8 (assuming White on bottom) displays detailed help.
</p>
<p>
Errors alert messages are logged, such as failures to load PGN games, incorrect PGN games or incorrect FEN strings. When an error is encountered, the top left chessboard square will flash to signal the exception. The error alert log can be reviewed clicking on the same top left chessboard square.
