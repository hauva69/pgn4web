<h2>features</h2>

<p style="clear:both">
The chess games viewer extension for Google Chrome is an interactive chessboard showing chess games from links to *.PGN URLs, from local *.PGN files and from PGN text, using context menus and page actions.
<ul>
<li>A context menu shows chess games from links to *.PGN chess games URLs; PGN (Portable Games Notation) files are commonly used to store and share chess games information. The live refresh option reloads the games periodically until all games are ended; use for links to chess games live broadcasts; a single large chessboard view is offered as well as a view with multiple small chessboards. The mouse cursor icon highlights links to *.PGN chess games URLs when hovering on them.</li>
<li>A context menu allows <a href="chess-games-viewer.html">showing chess games from local *.PGN files; drag and drop on the large chessboard view page also opens local *.PGN files</a>.</li>
<li>A context menu shows chess games from PGN chess games text selecetd in the web page.</li>
<li>A page action looks for links to *.PGN chess games URLs in the current page; if found, a page action icon in the address bar allows for opening the links in the chess games viewer.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The top left chessboard square will flash in case of PGN data errors, click that square for further details.

<h2>settings</h2>
<p>

    <li>Comment display within the game text: clicking on square C7 (assuming White on bottom) changes how comments are displayed respect to the move text, either inline or on separate lines.</li>
    <li>Chessboard move highlight: clicking on square D7 (assuming White on bottom) toggles the highlighting of the last move's from/to squares.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple small chessboards view
  <ul>
    <li>Maximum number of shown chessboards: if more games are available than currently shown, the "m" command at the top right of the page allows increasing the number of shown chessboards; if more than one game is currently shown, the "l" command allows reducing the number of shown chessboards; select the number of chessboard that better fits the screen.</li>
