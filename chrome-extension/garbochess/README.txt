THE GARBOCHESS CHESS ENGINE

GarboChess is a javascript chess engine by Gary Linscott.
Homepage: http://forwardcoding.com/projects/ajaxchess/chess.html
Repository: https://github.com/glinscott/Garbochess-JS/


IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

Please note that GarboChess is processor intensive; in order to optimise
computing resources, the chess games viewer extension allows only one chessboard
to be analyzed at any time; when starting analyzing a second chessboard, the
analysis of the first chessboard stops.
