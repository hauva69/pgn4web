Tilburg. At some point I was hoping to witness a masterpiece sacrifice win
from Kramnik, but apparently Anand was well prepared. }

ensued, finally a draw. } 15. h3 { $1 This innovation was suggested by
Anand's second Ubilava after the game in Linares. 15. h3 diverts Black's
Bishop control of the e6 square and makes sure the h Pawn will not be
captured when the Black's Queen arrives on h2. This innovation was voted
the 4th best innovation in Informant 74. } 15... Bh5 16. Nb3 Bh4 17. Nc5

[White "Howell, David"]
[Black "Kramnik, Vladimir"]
[Result "1/2-1/2"]
[ECO "C42"]
[Opening "Petrov"]
[Variation "classical attack, Chigorin variation"]

{ I did not attend in person any other top event until December 2009, more
than 10 years after the previous game in Tilburg; at that time I was in the
tournament hall in London, watching Kramnik sacrificing a piece in the same
variation of the Petrov. Again, I did not witness a masterpiece sacrifice
win from Kramnik, but the resemblance between the two games amazed me. }
