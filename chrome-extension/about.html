  The <i>chess games viewer extension for Google Chrome</i> is an interactive chessboard showing chess games from links to PGN URLs, from local PGN files and from PGN text, using <span title="Google Chrome's context menus appear when right-clicking a page, a link or selected text">context menus</span> and <span title="page actions icons appear at the right end of the Google Chrome's address bar; clicking a page action icon a popup page is shown">page actions</span>.
</div>
<div>
PGN (Portable Games Notation) files are commonly used by chess websites and by chess software to store and share chess games information.
</div>

<div class="extraSpacer"></div>
<h3><span title="Google Chrome's context menus appear when right-clicking a page, a link or selected text">context menu</span> for links to PGN chess games URLs</h3>
<div>
A <span title="Google Chrome's context menus appear when right-clicking a page, a link or selected text">context menu</span> shows chess games from links to PGN chess games URLs.
</div>
<div>
The mouse cursor icon highlights links to PGN chess games URLs when hovering on them.
</div>
<div class="try"><span class="try">try this</span>
right-click <a href="demoGames.pgn">this link to a PGN file</a> and select the menu item for viewing the chess games.
</div>

<div class="extraSpacer"></div>
<h3>live refresh mode</h3>
<div>
The live refresh mode reloads the games periodically until all games are ended, as designed for links to chess games live broadcasts, i.e. links to chess games files periodically updated on their server with new moves from games currently in progress. Many chess tournaments offer such live broadcast links from their websites.
</div>
<div>
Using the live refresh mode, the chess games viewer assumes the chess games link points to a live broadcast; if the live refresh mode is used instead with a link to a static chess games file, the chess games viewer will likely report that the live broadcast already ended, since the static games file will likely contain no games in progress.
</div>
<div>
A single large chessboard view is offered as well as a view with multiple small chessboards; click square H5 (assuming White on bottom) to switch between chessboard views.
</div>
<div>
During a live broadcast, the window title contains a set of three numbers, like "1.2.3 live broadcast" where the first number increases each time a new move is received for the visible games (acting as new move notification), the second is the overall number of live games and the third is the overall number of finished games.
</div>

<div class="try"><span class="try">try this</span>
right-click <a href="demoLiveGames.pgn">this link to a PGN file that simulates a live broadcast</a> and select the menu item for viewing the chess games with live refresh, either on a single board or on multiple boards. Click square H5 (assuming White on bottom) to switch between chessboard views.
<p/>
If you try instead the live refresh mode with <a href="demoGames.pgn">this link to a static PGN file</a>, the chess games viewer will not find any game in progress and will report the live broadcast as already ended.
</div>

<h3><span title="Google Chrome's context menus appear when right-clicking a page, a link or selected text">context menu</span> for links to ZIP archives</h3>
<div>
A <span title="Google Chrome's context menus appear when right-clicking a page, a link or selected text">context menu</span> for links to ZIP archives offers to inspect each ZIP archive for PGN chess games files.
</div>
<div>
Loading ZIP archives is a slow process; only the <i>deflate</i> and <i>store</i> compression methods are supported; encryption is not supported.
</div>
<div class="try"><span class="try">try this</span>
right-click <a href="zipped.zip">this link to a ZIP file</a> and select the menu item for inspecting the ZIP file for viewing the chess games.
</div>

<div class="extraSpacer"></div>
<h3><span title="Google Chrome's context menus appear when right-clicking a page, a link or selected text">context menu</span> for local PGN and ZIP files</h3>
<div>
A <span title="Google Chrome's context menus appear when right-clicking a page, a link or selected text">context menu</span> allows <a href="chess-games-viewer.html">showing chess games from local PGN files and local ZIP archives containing PGN files</a>; drag and drop on the large chessboard view page also opens local files.
</div>
<div>
A browser bookmark can be created for easy access to the chess games viewer page for showing local PGN and ZIP files.
</div>
<div class="try"><span class="try">try this</span>
first save locally <a href="demoGames.pgn">this PGN file</a> and <a href="zipped.zip">this ZIP file</a>, then right-click on the background of this page and select the menu item for opening local chess games files for viewing.

<p/>
Notes: in the popup of this page, "demoLiveGames.pgn" simulates a live chess broadcast when opened with live refresh; instead, "demoGames.pgn" is a static chess games file with no games in progress and the chess games viewer will report the live broadcast as already ended when opening it with live refresh.

</div>
<div>
Errors alert messages are logged, such as failures to load PGN games, incorrect PGN games or incorrect FEN strings. When an error is encountered, the top left chessboard square will flash to signal the exception. The error alert log can be reviewed clicking the same top left chessboard square.
