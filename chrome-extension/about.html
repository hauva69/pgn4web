<p>
The chess games viewer extension for Google Chrome is an interactive chessboard showing chess games from links to PGN URLs, from local PGN files and from PGN text, using context menus and page actions.
</p>
<p>
PGN (Portable Games Notation) files are commonly used by chess websites and by chess software to store and share chess games information.
</p>

<h3>context menu for links to PGN chess games URLs</h3>
<p>
A context menu shows chess games from links to PGN chess games URLs.
</p>
<p>
The mouse cursor icon highlights links to PGN chess games URLs when hovering on them.
</p>
<p class="try"><span class="try">try</span>
right-click <a href="dgt.pgn">this link to a PGN file</a> and select the menu item for viewing the chess games.
</p>

<h3>live refresh mode</h3>
<p>
The live refresh mode reloads the games periodically until all games are ended, as designed for links to chess games live broadcasts.
<p>
A single large chessboard view is offered as well as a view with multiple small chessboards; click square H5 (assuming White on bottom) to switch between chessboard views.
</p>
<p>
During a live broadcast, the window title contains a set of three numbers, like "1.2.3 live broadcast" where the first number increases each time a new move is received for the visible games (acting as new move notification), the second is the overall number of live games and the third is the overall number of finished games.
</p>

<p class="try"><span class="try">try</span>
the PGN files used for demo are not from a current live broadcast; using the chess games viewer extension menu items and links for viewing games with live refresh always reports the live broadcast as already ended; instead <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="chrome.tabs.create({url: 'chess-games-viewer.html?pgnData=dgt.pgn&refreshMinutes=0.1&refreshDemo=true'});">this link opens a demo live broadcast using the single large chessboard view</a> and <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="chrome.tabs.create({url: 'live-mosaic-viewer.html?pgnData=dgt.pgn&refreshMinutes=0.1&refreshDemo=true&headlessPage=true'});">this link opens a demo live broadcast using the multiple small chessboards view</a>.
</p>

<h3>context menu for links to ZIP archives</h3>
<p>
A context menu for links to ZIP archives offers to inspect each ZIP archive for PGN chess games files.
</p>
<p>
Loading ZIP archives is a slow process; only the <i>deflate</i> and <i>store</i> compression methods are supported; encryption is not supported.
</p>
<p class="try"><span class="try">try</span>
right-click <a href="zipped.zip">this link to a ZIP file</a> and select the menu item for inspecting the ZIP file for viewing the chess games.
</p>

<h3>context menu for local PGN and ZIP files</h3>
<p>
A context menu allows <a href="chess-games-viewer.html">showing chess games from local PGN files and local ZIP archives containing PGN files</a>; drag and drop on the large chessboard view page also opens local files.
</p>
<p>
A browser bookmark can be created for easy access to the chess games viewer page for showing local PGN and ZIP files.
</p>
<p class="try"><span class="try">try</span>
first save locally the PGN file and the ZIP file at the links above, then right-click on the background of this page and select the menu item for opening local chess games files for viewing.
</p>

<h3>context menu for selected PGN chess games text</h3>
<p>
A context menu shows chess games from PGN chess games text selected in the web page.
</p>
<p class="try"><span class="try">try</span>
select the PGN text below, then right-click and select the menu item for viewing the selected text as chess games.

</p>

<h3>page action for links to PGN chess games URLs</h3>
<p>
A page action looks for links to PGN chess games URLs in the current page; if found, a black pawn page action icon appears in the address bar, clicking that icon a popup page allows for opening the links in the chess games viewer.
</p>
<p class="try"><span class="try">try</span>
the black pawn icon should have appeared at the right end of the address bar of this page; click that icon to display the popup page and try clicking the action icons.
</p>

<h3>user interface help</h3>
<p>
Using the keyboard or clicking squares interacts with the chessboards; for instance, click square F5 (assuming White on bottom) to display the chess puzzler of the day; hovering the mouse on each square displays an help summary. Click square H8 (assuming White on bottom) to display detailed help.
</p>
<p>
Errors alert messages are logged, such as failures to load PGN games, incorrect PGN games or incorrect FEN strings. When an error is encountered, the top left chessboard square will flash to signal the exception. The error alert log can be reviewed clicking the same top left chessboard square.
