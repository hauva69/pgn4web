<div class="h3content">
<i>Comment display within the game text:</i> click square B7 (assuming White on bottom) to change whether comments are displayed or not into the move text; when comments are shown, click square C7 (assuming White on bottom) to change how comments are displayed respect to the move text, either inline or on separate lines.
</div>
<div class="h3content">
<i>Chessboard move highlight:</i> click square D7 (assuming White on bottom) to toggle the highlighting of the last move's from/to squares.
</div>

<div class="extraSpacer"></div>
<h3>multiple small chessboards view</h3>

<div class="h3content">
The <i>chess games viewer extension for Google Chrome</i> is an interactive chessboard showing chess games from links to PGN URLs, from local PGN files and from PGN text, using <span title="Google Chrome's context menus appear when right-clicking a page, a link or selected text">context menus</span> and <span title="page actions icons appear at the right end of the Google Chrome's address bar; clicking a page action icon a popup page is shown">page actions</span>.
</div>
<div class="h3content">
PGN (Portable Games Notation) files are commonly used by chess websites and by chess software to store and share chess games information. For example, <a href="http://www.chess.co.uk/twic/twic.html">The Week In Chess</a> site is an excellent source of chess news, with games collections and live broadcast of current events.
</div>

<div class="extraSpacer"></div>
<h3><span title="Google Chrome's context menus appear when right-clicking a page, a link or selected text">context menu</span> for links to PGN chess games URLs</h3>
<div class="h3content">
A <span title="Google Chrome's context menus appear when right-clicking a page, a link or selected text">context menu</span> shows chess games from links to PGN chess games URLs.
</div>
<div class="h3content">
The mouse cursor icon highlights links to PGN chess games URLs when hovering on them.
</div>
<div class="h3content try"><span class="try">try this</span>
right-click <a href="demoGames.pgn">this link to a PGN file</a> and select the chess games viewer menu item <i>"view chess games link on a single board"</i>.
</div>

<div class="extraSpacer"></div>
<h3>live refresh mode</h3>
<div class="h3content">
The live refresh mode reloads the games periodically until all games are ended, as designed for links to chess games live broadcasts, i.e. links to chess games files periodically updated on their server with new moves from games currently in progress. Many chess tournaments offer such live broadcast links from their websites.
</div>
<div class="h3content">
Using the live refresh mode, the chess games viewer assumes the chess games link points to a live broadcast; if the live refresh mode is used instead with a link to a static chess games file, the chess games viewer will likely report that the live broadcast already ended, since the static games file will likely contain no games in progress.
</div>
<div class="h3content">
A single large chessboard view is offered as well as a view with multiple small chessboards; click square H5 (assuming White on bottom) to switch between chessboard views. From the multiple small chessboards view, use the commands at the top right of the page to select how many chessboards and which ones are shown; click square A6 (assuming White on bottom) to hide a chessboard. 
</div>
<div class="h3content">
During a live broadcast, the window title contains a set of three numbers, like <i>"1.2.3 live broadcast"</i> where the first number increases each time a new move is received for the visible games (acting as new move notification), the second is the overall number of live games and the third is the overall number of finished games.
</div>

<div class="try h3content"><span class="try">try this</span>
right-click <a href="demoLiveGames.pgn">this link to a PGN file that simulates a live broadcast</a> and select the chess games viewer menu item <i>"view chess games link on a single board with live refresh"</i> or <i>"view chess games link on multiple boards with live refresh"</i>. Click square H5 (assuming White on bottom) to switch between chessboard views.
<p></p>
If you try instead the live refresh mode with <a href="demoGames.pgn">this link to a static PGN file</a>, the chess games viewer will not find any game in progress and will report the live broadcast as already ended.
</div>

<h3><span title="Google Chrome's context menus appear when right-clicking a page, a link or selected text">context menu</span> for links to ZIP archives</h3>
<div class="h3content">
A <span title="Google Chrome's context menus appear when right-clicking a page, a link or selected text">context menu</span> for links to ZIP archives offers to inspect each ZIP archive for PGN chess games files. Since ZIP files only occasionally contain chess games in PGN format, those links are not highlighted by the mouse cursor icon; they are also ignored by the page action icon and by the page action popup page (see below). 
</div>
<div class="h3content">
Loading ZIP archives is a slow process; only the <i>deflate</i> and <i>store</i> compression methods are supported; encryption is not supported.
</div>
<div class="try h3content"><span class="try">try this</span>
right-click <a href="zipped.zip">this link to a ZIP file</a> and select the chess games viewer menu item <i>"inspect ZIP archive link for PGN chess games"</i>.

A <span title="Google Chrome's context menus appear when right-clicking a page, a link or selected text">context menu</span> allows <a href="chess-games-viewer.html">showing chess games from local PGN files and local ZIP archives containing PGN files</a>; drag and drop on the large chessboard view page also opens local files.
</div>
<div class="h3content">
A browser bookmark can be created for easy access to the chess games viewer page for showing local PGN and ZIP files, simply use the browser command for creating a bookmark from that page.
</div>
<div class="try h3content"><span class="try">try this</span>
first save locally <a href="demoLiveGames.pgn">this PGN file</a> and <a href="zipped.zip">this ZIP file</a>, then right-click on the background of this page and select the chess games viewer menu item <i>"open local PGN chess games FILES for viewing on a single board"</i>. In the newly opened chessboard page use the <i>"files"</i> command at the top right of the page to open the saved chess games files.

<h3>chess engine game analysis</h3>
<div class="h3content">
The single large chessboard view of the chess games viewer integrates a chess engine for game analysis.
</div>
<div class="h3content">
Toggle the chess engine game analysis clicking square H2 of the single large chessboard view. Positive evaluations favor White, while -1 means Black is approximately a pawn ahead.
</div>
<div class="h3content">
When the analysis engine is active, a graph shows the position's evaluation throughout the game. A vertical bar above the horizontal line corresponds to a positive evaluation (White's advantage). The graph uses a logarithmic scale for easier appreciation of small changes for values below 1 pawn unit. The current move is highlighted. Clicking any of the vertical bars moves the chessboard to the corresponding move. Click square G2 for automatic game annotation.
</div>
<div class="h3content">
In order to optimize computing resources, the chess games viewer extension allows only one chessboard to be analyzed at any time; when starting analyzing a second chessboard, the analysis of the first chessboard stops. The analysis of each position pauses after 10 minutes. Some analysis engine's data is automatically saved for use in following sessions. The performance the javascript based engine is relatively limited compared to professional engines optimized for each processing environment; use the chess games viewer analysis engine for high-level assessments, for detailed analysis please refer to a chess engine optimized for the chosen computing platform.
</div>

<div class="extraSpacer"></div>
<h3>user interface help</h3>
<div class="h3content">
Interact with the chessboards clicking the squares or using the keyboard; for instance, click square F5 (assuming White on bottom) to display the chess puzzler of the day. Hover the mouse on each square for an help summary. From the single large chessboard view, click square H8 (assuming White on bottom) for detailed help.
</div>
<div class="h3content">
Errors alert messages are logged, such as failures to load PGN games, incorrect PGN games or incorrect FEN strings. When an error is encountered, the top left chessboard square will flash to signal the exception. The error alert log can be reviewed clicking the same top left chessboard square.
